Dream Vaults
============

Design Principles:
------------------

- Easy recording of dreams (obviously)
- Detailed classification mechanisms available
- Various levels of anonymity when desired for privacy
    - partial anonymity masks names of people and places (and
      relationship)
    - full anonymity masks names of people and places and does not
      identify dream with author's account
- Social network elements (follow, friend)
- Dream comments
- integration with other social networks (for login & sharing)
- API so apps can be created for other platforms
- Analysis features
    - dream search engine
    - tag/mood/reaction analysis
    - similar dreams
- General discussion threads (probably third party hosted)
- dream art (attach media)
