Build a working environment.

make.sh:

    1. Make sure system dependencies are installed
    2. Create virtual python environment
    3. Install python dependencies
    4. Create a Django project
    5. Symlink this code under Django project

When the script is finished, you should have a fully working
installation. However, some setup may still be required.

Note, the following assumptions are made:

    - pip is available
    - virtualenv is available
    - debian based system (apt-get)
